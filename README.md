# COMP90018- VIC Market


## 1. introduction:
In this project, we developed an Android application named VIC Market, which is a second-hand commodity trading platform for victorian people.  
 
The user data and commodity data are stored in a database on the server. We built a back-end application using Spring Boot framework to provide a series of RESTful APIs using HTTP protocol for the interaction between the client, that is, the Android application, and the server. 
 
For the sensor part, we used three sensors of mobile phones, namely the GPS, the gyroscope and the acceleration sensor.
